# Spot Quote 📝✨

**Spot Quote** is a social platform where users can share their thoughts, quotes, and ideas in a simple and elegant way.  
I built this project to practice **full-stack development**, focusing on authentication, image storage, and responsive UI, while preparing for real-world app features I can reuse in future Android/web projects. 🚀
